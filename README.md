## TODO
- [x] obtain static list of (cimrman) gifs, keywords and image urls
- [x] search in keywords
- [x] reasonable display of gif previews
- [x] copy to clipboard
- [x] random shuffle on load
- [x] display webm instead of gifs (better quality/size ratio)
- [ ] display mp4 instead of webm (better quality/size ratio)
- [ ] vanishing tooltip alert after clipboard copy
- [x] cleanup json (remove redundant image urls)
- [ ] option to select gif quality to be shared
- [ ] smart/dynamic image load (only when displayed)
- [x] search for multiple keywords (separate query by whitespaces)
- [x] ignore list for gifs that have nothing to do with mr. Jarunka
- [ ] support regex search (without that we can't search for "jak" only as it is contained in "smoljak")
